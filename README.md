A simple CLI app to interact with Notion API and view tasks.

</div>

Recently i discovered the [P.A.R.A Method](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) a system to created to organize
digital life. I decided to build my second brain in Notion, and sometimes i don't have the Web/App opened.

So i decided to create a CLI app to interact with Notion API and my P.A.R.A Method, and i can easily view my tasks, projects
and more in my terminal.
